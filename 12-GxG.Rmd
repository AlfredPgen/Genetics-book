# Gene-gene interaction

When the combined phenotypic effect of alleles at two or more loci deviates from the sum of their individual effects, this is referred to as a genetic interaction, or epistasis.There are some situations where data and theory have suggested that it might be particularly important to account for genetic interactions. One is when the aim is to predict the phenotypes of individuals on the basis of their genotype. If interactions lead to extreme phenotypes for some genotypes, these phenotypes are unlikely to be captured by additive models, particularly if they are rare.

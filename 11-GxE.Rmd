# Gene-environment interaction

Identification of gene-environment interactions has important implications for understanding underlying disease etiology and developing disease prevention and intervention strategies.

## Set-based interaction tests

There are multiple reasons for using set-based gene-environment interaction tests. 

1. Multiple comparison adjustments for a large number of markers across the genome could result in power loss.
2. Closely located SNPs are correlated because of linkage disequilibrium. Multiple tests for GxE in these single-marker-based GxE models are even more dependent, as interaction terms in these models share the same environmental variable. Dependence among multiple tests can result in incorrect Type 1 error rates and causes bias in standard multiple comparison adjustments and this bias is often difficult to correct.
3. The single-marker GxE test does not interrogate the joint effects of multiple SNPs that have similar biological functions. When the main effects of multiple SNPs in a set are  associated with a disease/trait, the classical single marker regression interaction test can be biased.

Lin et al. (2013) developed a method to analyse GxE for a set of markers using generalized linear mixed models. The method tests for SNP-set by environment interactions using a variance component test, and because a set of variants will likely be correlated, the main SNP effect estimates under the null hypothesis are obtained using ridge regression. 
Their software is called GESAT. Here, they model GxE effects as random, as opposed to the classical approach of treating *β<sub>j</sub>*’s as fixed effects followed by a test with *p* degrees of freedom. The latter approach can suffer from power loss when *p* is moderate/large, and numerical difficulties when some genetic markers in the set are in high LD. 
The model allows to adjust for the main effects of all SNPs while simultaneously testing for the interactions between the SNPs in the region and environmental variable. For unbalanced designs when a binary environmental exposure has a low frequency in one category, GESAT is most advantageous over single marker regression GxE test. Such unbalanced designs can occur due to case–control sampling and the strong association of an environmental factor with disease. When the effect size is modest, GESAT performs better that single marker regression GxE test, but when the effect size is strong, the opposite is true. 
Their simulations suggest that the power of GESAT seems fairly robust to the dependence between G and E.

The same approach can be applied to investigating various other biological problems. For example, we can test for the interactions between gene expressions in a pathway or network and an environmental variable by simply replacing G by gene expressions in a gene-set.

Existing methods for assessing common variants by environment interactions such as Gene-Environment Set Association Test (GESAT) (Lin et al., 2013) have several limitations when applied for rare variants. GESAT estimates the main effects of the common variants by applying a L<sub>2</sub> penalty on the genotypes scaled to unit variance; this assumes that the main effects of the scaled genotypes are comparable in magnitudes, which may not hold in the case of rare variants. GESAT also assumes that the regression coefficients of the rare variants by environment interactions are independent of each other, and suffers from power loss when most rare variants in a gene interact with the environmental factor and the interaction effects have the same direction.

Similar idea from GESAT was later extended and applied to analyse rare variants. GESAT have several limitations when applied for rare variants. GESAT estimates the main effects of the common variants by applying a L<sub>2</sub> penalty on the genotypes scaled to unit variance; this assumes that the main effects of the scaled genotypes are comparable in magnitudes, which may not hold in the case of rare variants. GESAT also assumes that the regression coefficients of the rare variants by environment interactions are independent of each other, and suffers from power loss when most rare variants in a gene interact with the environmental factor and the interaction effects have the same direction. The new proposed test iSKAT is optimal in a class of variance component tests and is powerful and robust to the proportion of variants in a gene that interact with environment and the signs of the effects. This test properly controls for the main effects of the rare variants using weighted ridge regression while adjusting for covariates.

A naive approach to assess rare variants by environment interactions is to extend the burden test by fitting a model with both the summary genetic burden variable, environment, and their interaction, and performing a one degree of freedom test for the interaction. However, when there are multiple causal variants with their main effects having different magnitudes and/or signs, such a burden rare variant by environment test fails, and may lead to inflated Type 1 error rates. This is because adjusting for the main effects of the multiple causal variants using a single summary genetic burden variable is inappropriate. Likewise, a naive approach to assess rare variants by environment interactions using SKAT by including the main effects of rare variants as part of covariates and applying SKAT to the interaction terms is problematic. This is because SKAT only allows adjustment of a small number of covariates and cannot handle the presence of a large number of rare variants in a region. Furthermore since the rare variants are observed in low frequency, a model with all the rare variants as main effects will be highly unstable and may not even converge.

Both GESAT and iSKAT are able to incorporate multiple environmental variables.

No gene-based GxE test exists for the analysis of the sex chromosomes as of writing this text.

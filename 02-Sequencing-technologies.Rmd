# Sequencing technologies

The first step in any genetic analysis is to map sequence reads, callibrate base qualities, and call variants. 

Prior to mapping, evaluate base composition along reads. Calculate the proportion of A, C, G, T bases along each read. Flag runs with evidence of unusual patterns of base composition compared to the target genome.
Evaluate machine quality scores along reads. Calculate average quality scores per position. Flag runs with evidence of unusual quality score distributions.
Calculate the input number of reads and number of bases for each sequenced sample

## Sequence alignment

Sequence alignment is a method of arranging sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. The similarity being identified, may be a result of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

If we compare two sequences, it is known as pairwise sequence alignment. If we compare more than two sequences, it is known as multiple sequence alignment.

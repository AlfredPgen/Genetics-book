## Sequence alignment

Sequence alignment is a method of arranging sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. The similarity being identified, may be a result of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

If we compare two sequences, it is known as pairwise sequence alignment. If we compare more than two sequences, it is known as multiple sequence alignment.

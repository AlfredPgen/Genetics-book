# Combining multiple datasets

## Meta-analysis

### Meta-analysis of gene-level associations (common)?

### Meta-analysis of rare variants

## Mega-analysis


## Z-statistic to estimated SNP effect

After sample-size-weighted meta-analysis, Z-statistics can be transformed into unstandardized regression coefficinets using the following equation:

$$\LARGE \hat{\beta_j} = Z_j\frac{\hat{\sigma_Y}}{\sqrt{2N_j MAF_j(1-MAF_j)}}$$

## Convert Z-statistic to estimated SNP effect

After sample-size-weighted meta-analysis, Z-statistics can be transformed into unstandardized regression coefficinets using the following equation:

$$\LARGE \hat{\beta_j} = Z_j\frac{\hat{\sigma_Y}}{\sqrt{2N_j MAF_j(1-MAF_j)}}$$
for SNP *j* with minor allele frequency MAF*j*, sample size N*j*, Z-statistic Z*j*𝑍𝑗, and standard deviation of the phenotype $\hat{\sigma_Y}$𝑌.
